# A recipe for weather regimes in Python

![Baking a map](image.jpeg)

The notebook `recipe.ipynb` contains a clear recipe to calculate weather regimes on a set of NetCDF files. I have shared a dataset with daily 500 hPa geopotential height from ERA5 [on a Zenodo repository](https://zenodo.org/record/8384348). 

To run this notebook you need Python (tested on 3.11), `xarray`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `eofs`, `dask`, `netcdf4`.
